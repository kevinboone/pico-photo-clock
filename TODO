- User interface for setting the time
- Alternative display with, say, just the time (including seconds) in a
  very large font

Note that, although the LCD panel has a touch digitizer, my case design
has the display behind a 5mm sheet of tinted perspex, so it can't be
used. Consequently, I'm reluctant to implement anything that requires
a user interface.
